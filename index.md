## FAQ: General

### What is the Demoscene?

> The demoscene is an international computer art subculture focused on producing demos: self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that produce audio-visual presentations.
  The purpose of a demo is to show off programming, visual art, and musical skills. Demos and other demoscene productions are shared at festivals known as demoparties, voted on by those who attend, and released online.

### What is a Demoparty?

> A demoparty is an event that gathers demosceners and other computer enthusiasts to partake in competitions called Demoscene compos of demos (short audio-visual presentations of computer art). A typical demoparty is a non-stop event spanning a weekend, providing the visitors a lot of time to socialize. The competing works, at least those in the most important competitions, are usually shown at night, using a video projector and loudspeakers. The most important competition is usually the demo compo.

- Occasionally ad-hoc meet-ups by demosceners take place in the South / South-West (Bristol Area) and in the North (Slipstream events). Slipstream plan to host a demoscene party in the future at some point. The Slack #general channel is good to keep an eye on for upcoming meetings.

### What international parties are frequented by UK Demosceners?

The most popular international demoparty is Revision (https://revision-party.net), but many UK sceners go to Evoke (https://www.evoke.eu/) and Outline (http://outlinedemoparty.nl/).

## FAQ: Slack

### Slack Information

The UK Demoscene has an online Slack run by Chris Wood (psonice) and Ruairi Fullam (rc55).

It is intended to be a work-safe environment for demosceners to chat. Those wishing to post non work-safe content are welcome to create their own private, non-public channels and solicit invites from others as long as the content is explicitly indicated as safe or not safe for work.

Main channels include:

- **#general** - General demoscene discussion
- **#random** - Off-topic chatter
- **#nova** - Nova Demoparty chat
- **#coding** - Chat about programming, demoscene or not
- **#music-production** - Discussion around music production

Supplementary channels include:

- **#fitness** - Health and fitness / goal-setting discussion
- **#gaming** - Discussion around computer / console gaming

Moderators (Bossman, psonice and rc55) can be found in #moderators - however this channel should only be used if an issue arises.

### Slack Rules

_These rules are considered a work in progress_

- Language can be as colourful as you wish, however topics should be generally suitable for public consumption.
- During UK working hours (8AM-6PM), collapse all image based links posted to main channels. This includes link previews to web sites.
- No NSFW images should be posted to any channel.
- If a NSFW image or topic needs to be discussed, feel free to set up a **private** channel and you can solicit invites from users in the channels to join.
